## CriticalPathType: controls dependencies between and chilrdren of
#                   `da` and `forecast` mini-workflows
# OPTIONS:
# + Normal - run both the `da` and `forecast` mini-workflows, each with a dependency on the
#            previous instance of the other
#          - run selected verification elements with dependence on the `da` and `forecast`
#            mini-workflow sub-tasks
# + Bypass - do not run either `da` or `forecast` mini-workflows
#          - only run `verification` mini-workflows, including non-critical path forecasts, e.g.,
#            VerifyExtendedMeanFC
# + Reanalysis
#   - run only the `da` mini-workflow in the critical path, and also verification
#   - requires CyclingFC forecast files or links to already be present in ExperimentDirectory
# + Reforecast
#   - run only the `forecast` mini-workflow in the critical path, and also verification
#   - requires CyclingDA analysis files or links to already be present in ExperimentDirectory
#
# Users may choose whether to run the verification concurrently with and
# dependent on the critical path tasks (`Normal`), or as an independent post-processing step
# (`Bypass`). `Normal` and `Bypass` cover most use-cases for "continuous cycling" experiments.
#
# Setting `CriticalPathType` to either `Reanalysis` or `Reforecast` gives two variations of
# "partial cycling", where each cycle is independent and does not depend on any of the previous
# cycles. `Reanalysis` is used to perform the `da` task on each cycle without re-running
# forecasts.  This requires the `forecast` output files to already be present in the experiment
# directory.  If the user wishes to do this for independently-generated forecasts (i.e., from a
# previous separate experiment or a set of forecasts generated outside `MPAS-Workflow`), they
# must manually create an experiment directory, then either link or copy the forecast files into the
# `CyclingFC` directory following the usual directory structure and file-naming conventions.
# `Reforecast` is used to perform forecasts from an existing set of analysis states, which similarly
# must be already stored or linked in the `CyclingDA` directory following normal directory structures
# and file naming conventions.  It is recommended to run at least one `Normal` experiment to
# demonstrate the correct directory structure before trying either of the `Reanalysis` or
# `Reforecast` options.
  CriticalPathType: Normal

## VerifyDeterministicDA: whether to run verification scripts for
#    obs feedback files produced by DA.  Does not work for ensemble DA.
#    Only works when CriticalPathType == Normal.
# OPTIONS: True/False
  VerifyDeterministicDA: True

#    after the DA verification completes
# OPTIONS: True/False
  CompareDA2Benchmark: False

## VerifyExtendedMeanFC: whether to run verification scripts across
#    extended forecast states, first intialized at mean analysis
# OPTIONS: True/False
  VerifyExtendedMeanFC: False

## VerifyBGMembers: whether to run verification scripts for CyclingWindowHR
#    forecast length. Runs HofXBG, VerifyObsBG, and VerifyModelBG on critical
#    path forecasts that are initialized from ensemble member analyses.
# OPTIONS: True/False
  VerifyBGMembers: False

## CompareBG2Benchmark: compare verification statistics files between two experiments
#    after the BGMembers verification completes
# OPTIONS: True/False

## VerifyEnsMeanBG: whether to run verification scripts for ensemble mean
#    background (nMembers > 1) or deterministic background (nMembers == 1)
# OPTIONS: True/False
  VerifyEnsMeanBG: True

## DiagnoseEnsSpreadBG: whether to diagnose the ensemble spread in observation
#    space while VerifyEnsMeanBG is True.  Automatically triggers HofXBG
#    for all ensemble members.
# OPTIONS: True/False
  DiagnoseEnsSpreadBG: True

## VerifyEnsMeanAN: whether to run verification scripts for ensemble
#    mean analysis state.
# OPTIONS: True/False
  VerifyANMembers: False

## VerifyExtendedEnsBG: whether to run verification scripts across
#    extended forecast states, first intialized at ensemble of analysis
#    states.
# OPTIONS: True/False
  VerifyExtendedEnsFC: False
