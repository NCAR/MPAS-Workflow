  # Need x1.655362.static.nc to include var2d, con, oa{1,2,3,4}, and ol{1,2,3,4} fields
  # alternatively could use /glade/work/liuz/pandac/prepare_mpas/mpas_static_30km/x1.655362.static.nc,
  # but no such file exists for 60km mesh.  This might skew comparisons to 30km GFS analyses produced
  # offline using /glade/work/liuz/pandac/prepare_mpas/mpas_static_30km/x1.655362.static.nc.  The
  # ultimate action item then is to look deeper into the x1.*.static.nc file generation process,
  # and determine if it is viable to bring into the workflow.  Ideally those files should be
  # generated using the same MPAS-A code version as is used in the initic and forecast applications.
