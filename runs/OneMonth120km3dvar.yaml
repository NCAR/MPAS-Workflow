## scenarios
# list of test scenarios to run, ordered from most simple to most complex
# If multiple test scenarios fail, it is advisable to progress by debugging and re-testing with only
# the most simple of the failing scenarios until it passes in order to reduce computational overhead.
# Then proceed with the remainder of the scenarios until all complete.

# Controls the ExpSuffix in config/experiment.csh.  If testing for multiple branches or across
# non-yaml-configured settings, it is convenient to modify this suffix here in order to distinguish
# the scenarios.

# Queue that will be used for critical path jobs.  If time allows, it is best to use economy.
